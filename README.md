# my-framework-rocks

myframework.rocks website source code (MIT)

myframework.rocks compare frameworks by the code, with real code examples based on real-life-oriented
business applications.

Initially created for PHP Frameworks such as I.T. Rocks, Laravel, Symfony and Yii, this code
snippets repository can accept codes coming from others frameworks and languages.

My wish is that becomes a tool to discuss about programming techniques and philosophy, and help
developers to make their mind about what great and maintainable code should look like, and some of
them to choose their working tool from real code instead of from abstract concepts.

*For the love of code !*
